# Rubik's Cube Solver - AeroHack 2025

A smart 3x3 Rubik's Cube solver built during **AeroHack 2025** at Collins Aerospace. Solves scrambled cubes using heuristic-driven search and visualizes the solution step-by-step with Pygame.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Digital 3x3 cube simulation with all 12 valid moves
- Heuristic-based solver (Iterative Deepening DFS + pruning)
- Real-time Pygame visualization
- Step-by-step solving with user control
- Test cases with scramble & verification

## ðŸŽ® Controls
- `1`â€“`4`: Select test case  
- `S`: Apply scramble  
- `SPACE`: Apply next solution move


## ðŸš€ Run It
```bash
python demo.py
```
## Visual Demo
```bash
python visual.py
